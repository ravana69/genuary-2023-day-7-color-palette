# Genuary 2023 Day 7: Color Palette

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/mdjpZdr](https://codepen.io/tsuhre/pen/mdjpZdr).

For the color palette prompt, I picked the poster art for Finding Nemo because I really liked all of the colors in that movie. 

The algorithm places a bunch of rectangles that wander around the source image and paint the corresponding leading edges onto a different set of rectangles wandering around the canvas. This results in a nice brushstroke effect that I'm really happy with.

You should be able to replace the source image with any other image and have it paint a corresponding picture.
